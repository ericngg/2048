# Spotify Top 100 Song Analysis of 2019
Eric Ng CSE 163 Project Final

## Instructions on installations:
The libraries I installed are plotly, plotly-orca, and kaleido. Plotly is for creating graphs and plotly-orca/kaleido are for exporting plotly static images. Plotly-orca needs to be installed through conda. Some other libraries I used that should already be installed are base64, requests, datetime, json, and urlencode. Once everything is installed, the ipynb should run as intended.

## Instructions on running:
My analysis is written in JupyterNotebook. If possible, I would prefer running the analysis on the ipynb file instead of the py file. I did my analysis on JupyterNotebook because I used libraries that are not on Ed and I used the SpotifyAPI which did not work locally on Ed. The py file is a replication from the ipynb, but I could not test it fully due to some libraries are not available on Ed. To run the ipynb file, you just need to go down the cells in order. They should be organized well enough to work in order.
